# USB Connection Modes for Phone and Computer


In general, when connecting your phone to a computer via USB, you can try the following steps:

1. Connect your phone to the computer using a USB cable.

2. On your phone, you may see a notification or a prompt asking what the USB connection is used for. The wording or options may vary, but common options include:

   - File Transfer
   - Media Device (MTP)
   - Charging only
   - USB Debugging
   - Tethering or Mobile hotspot
   - MIDI, Camera, or PTP modes (less common)

3. Select the option that best suits your purpose. If you want to run your Flutter code on your phone, you typically need to choose the option that allows file transfer or media device mode (MTP).

If you are unable to find the appropriate option or if your phone does not display any USB connection prompt, you can try the following steps:

1. Connect your phone to the computer via USB.

2. Go to your phone's settings.

3. Look for the "Developer options" or "Developer settings" section. If you can't find it, go to the "About phone" section, and tap on the "Build number" multiple times until you see a message indicating that you have unlocked the developer options.

4. Once you have accessed the developer options, look for an option related to USB debugging or USB connection mode. Enable USB debugging or select the appropriate USB connection mode that allows file transfer or media device (MTP) mode.

If you're still having trouble finding the right option or if the prompts on your phone are different, I recommend referring to your phone's user manual or contacting the manufacturer's support for specific instructions related to USB connections and debugging on your particular phone model.
